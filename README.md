The _RaspberryMatic_ project is a collaborate effort to provide a lightweight, [Linux/buildroot](http://buildroot.org/)-based HomeMatic compatible operating system for embedded single board computers (SBC) like the [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) or [Tinkerboard](https://www.asus.com/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board-S/). It is meant to provide a an alternative operating system for [CCU3](https://www.homematic-ip.com/en/products/detail/smart-home-central-control-unit-ccu3.html) or [ELV Charly](https://www.elv.de/elv-smart-home-zentrale-charly-starter-set-bausatz.html) systems. It is based on the **O**pen-**C**entral-**C**ontrol-**U**nit-SDK ([OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu)) provided by [eQ-3](http://eq-3.de) as part of the [HomeMatic](http://homematic.com/) home automation platform. The RaspberryMatic distribution is provided as a full operating system image that can be flashed and then used in a RaspberryPi/Tinkerboard as the main operating system for controlling all HomeMatic compatible devices with full compatibility to a CCU device directly sold by eQ-3.

## :telescope: Compatible Third-Party CCU Addons
The CCU platform allows to enhance the functionality of a CCU by installing so-called CCU Addon packages. For RaspberryMatic, standard CCU Addon packages won't work because included binaries have to be recompiled for the hard-float buildroot environment RaspberryMatic uses. Here is a list of well-known already compatible Addon packages (please note that this list might be incomplete):

* [CUxD](https://github.com/jens-maus/cuxd)
* [XML-API](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/XML-API)

## :cloud: Installation
The installation of RaspberryMatic is quite straight forward as it is delivered as a full system image that can be directly flashed onto a microSD / eMMC and put into the corresponding SBC. As such the installation consists of the following basic steps:

1. [Download latest release](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases) archive (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`) for the hardware platform you are using:
   * `wget https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases/download/X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD/RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`
2. Unarchive zip file resulting in an SD card image (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img`), e.g.:
   * `unzip RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`
3. Check sha256 checksum to check integrity of SD card image, e.g.:
   * `sha256sum -c RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img.sha256`
4. Use the  image flasher tool "Etcher" (https://etcher.io) to flash the `*.img` file to your SD card or USB drive. As an alternative you can also use the following command-line calls to manually flash it on Unix-based operating systems:
   * <i>Linux</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M conv=fsync`
   * <i>macOS</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1m`
5. For RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB use only: Make sure you have the RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB radio module correctly installed on the GPIO
6. Install microSD in your SBC and connect power
7. Wait until bootup process is finished and use a web browser to connect to http://homematic-raspi/

## :memo: Documentation
Documentation (e.g. how to port your HomeMatic configuration from a CCU2/CCU3 to RaspberryMatic) and installation support is currently limited to using a mostly german language speaking fora with the following links pointing to the relevant sections of the fora where you can find documentation and help about RaspberryMatic:

* [RaspberryMatic - Installation Guide :de:](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=34497#p328057)

## :yum: How to contribute
As the RaspberryMatic project is an open source based project everyone is invited to contribute to this project. Please note, however, that functionality within the corresponding eQ-3 OCCU binaries can not be modified as the main HomeMatic services (rfd, ReGaHSS, HMServer, etc.) are provided in binary format by the [OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu) project and not compiled from sources. Nevertheless, if you are a talented developer and want to contribute to the success of RaspberryMatic feel free to send over pull requests or report issues / enhancement requests. Please note, however, the licensing and contributing implications and accept that - in short - anything you contribute to this repository/project (especially source code) will be (re)licensed under the Apache 2.0 license (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). In addition, please understand that we will only accept contributions (either source code or issues in the issue tracker) if these comply to our [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### :moneybag: Donations [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RAQSDY9YNZVCL)
Even for those that don't have the technical knowhow to help developing on RaspberryMatic there are ways to support our development. Please consider sending us a donation to not only help us to compensate for expenses regarding RaspberryMatic, but also to keep our general development motivation on a high level. So if you want to donate some money please feel free to send us money via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RAQSDY9YNZVCL). And if you are running a business which might integrate RaspberryMatic in one of your products please contact us for a regular donation plan which could not only show that you do care about open source development, but also could secure your product by ensuring that development on RaspberryMatic continues in future.

### :construction: Development
Building your own RaspberryMatic SD card image is a very straight forward process using this build environment – given that you have sufficient Linux/Unix knowledge and you know what you are actually doing. But if you know what you are doing and which host tools are required to actually be able to run a RaspberryMatic build, it should be as simple as:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic
$ cd RaspberryMatic
$ make dist
[wait up to 1h]
$ make install of=/dev/sdX
```

#### :bookmark: Using the generated cross compiler
After a successfull build of RaspberryMatic a dedicated cross compiler (`arm-linux-gcc`) should be available within the `build-raspmatic_rpi3` path. You can use this GCC-based cross compiler to compile all kind of third party applications which can then be run within RaspberryMatic:

```sh
$ cd HelloWorld
$ <path-to-RaspberryMatic-build>/build-raspmatic_rpi3/host/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c
```

A valid alternative for building RaspberryMatic ARM-hardfloat compatible binaries is to use the following Linux cross compiler suite [supplied by the RaspberryPi foundation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708/arm-rpi-4.9.3-linux-gnueabihf).

## :scroll: License
